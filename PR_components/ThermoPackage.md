The Soave-Redlich-Kwong (SKR) cubic equation of state will be used for all simulations.
According to Aspen, SKR gives reasonable results for all temperatures and pressures and 
is best for nonpolar or mildly polar mixtures such as hydrocarbons and light gases. 
This matches up well with the reactions in the phthalic anhydride plant as o-xylene is a 
hydrocarbon, oxygen is a light gas, phthalic anhydride and maleic anydride are mildly polar, 
and CO2 is a light gas.
