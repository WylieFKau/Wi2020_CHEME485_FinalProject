# Planning Report - CHEME 485 Final Project
### Contributors: Natasha Braunstein, Aubrey Phillips, Evan Epstein, and Wylie Kau

In this project, we are performing preliminary process design in order to scale a Phthalic anhydride production process to a 100,000 metric ton per year based on utilizing o-xylene as the raw feedstock material. Utilizing a new catalyst that minimizes side reactions and eliminates carbon monoxide production, a grassroots facility has been proposed for the scaled process.

The process will be fed air and pure o-xylene (OX) to form Phthalic anhydride (PA), Maleic anhydride (MA), water, and carbon dioxide (CO2). OX and air streams are prepped and fed to a catalytic bed reactor (type TBD) where exothermic reaction of raw feed materials will occur, competing with exothermic combustion of desired products PA and MA. The reactor product stream will be fed to 1 of a set of 3 specialized condenser units for desublimation. While one condenser is operating, the second will be on standby, while the third will be melting the desublimated products, the condenser units rotating between operating modes. The condenser stage product will be a V-L stream with a MA/PA rich liquid and a MA/PA poor vapor containing the rest of the non-condensables (CO2, water, and air). The liquid stream will be sent to a series of two distillation columns for separation and the vapor ("dirty air") will be sent to waste treatment.

The grassroots facility and process will be designed with the following targets:<br>
- 100,000 metric tons/yr Phthalic nhydride produced
- 99.9 wt% Phthalic anhydride purity
- 95.0 wt% Maleic anhydride purity
